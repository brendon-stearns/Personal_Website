    <p>I am an engineer, explorer, problem solver, builder, breaker, fixer, skier, biker, and a life long learner.</p>
    <p>As a recent graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology, I have a MS in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. I did my undergraduate at Northeastern University where I majored in Mechanical Engineering and a minored in Bio-mechanical Engineering.</p>
    <p>While I enjoy mechanical engineering, I believe many of the most important tools today combine beautiful mechanical design with the power of modern computation. I look forward to taking my knowledge of mechanical engineering into the software engineering field. The combination of these disciplines gives me a well rounded foundation that differentiates me from others.</p>
    <p>My previous mechanical professional experience includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The vet-tech industry</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed surgical implants and tools</li>
            </ul>
        <li>The medical industry</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Worked with needle-less injection technology</li>
            </ul>
        <li>The drone industry</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Hydrogen fuel cell technology</li>
            </ul>
        <li>The automotive industry</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Testing and verification for small motors and actuators</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
